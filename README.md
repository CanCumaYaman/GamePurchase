# GamePurchase
We can add game,gamer,campaign and soldGame to database with EntityFramework. We cannot add same gamer in db. We cannot sell the game which campaign expired.

When I made this app, I used layered architecture. Layers are Entity, DataAcces, Business, Core(same codes all project) and I used Console for UI.
